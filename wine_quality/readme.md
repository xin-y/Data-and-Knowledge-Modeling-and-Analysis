Objectives:

• Loading datasets and perform some basic data preprocessing.
• Studying how to apply some of the methods discussed in class on different
datasets. 

1: Effect of Normalization, Feature Extraction and Distance Metrics
Normalization: None vs. Z-score normalization
Feature extraction: PCA and LDA
Distance Metrics：
using a variety of data point weighting schemes including 
• uniform weighting (default)
• distance based weight with manhattan distance
• distance based weight with euclidean distance

2. Linear Dimensionality Reduction
• PCA
• LDA

3. Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction
• kernel PCA
• Isomap
• Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)
• Laplacian Eigenmap (sklearn.manifold.SpectralEmbedding)
• t-SNE
