Task:
Explore the dataset, analyse its properties
Perform classification of the new label
Technologies to use:
python
scikitlearn
keras and tensorflow
Algorithms to use at minimum:
PCA
Clasic ML Method such as Random Forests or kernel SVM.
CNNs
you will also be able to use any other algorithms or Deep Neural Network architectures that you want to try out (e.g. Resnet, Inception, Autoencoders, â€¦)
